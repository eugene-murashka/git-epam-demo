sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field

It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme

To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
